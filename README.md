# Tetris-EXE<br />
Tetris, but just the application<br />
Extract the ZIP called tetris after you extract the first ZIP<br />
Look for the orange hand looking thing, that's the application itself<br />
Make sure to extract it all together, if it misses files, it will not run<br />
It will create a JSON file to save your scores, it will be called data, delete it if you want to reset your scores<br />
